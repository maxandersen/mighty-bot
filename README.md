# mighty-github

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that Bot to help maintain your github boards automatically

Initial version based on https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot, with the added benefit it will trigger for updates to issues not just on creation of issues. 

To create an Automation Card, create a Card in a Project like this:

```

```
